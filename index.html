        <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Based in London, I am a technology integration expert with a strong focus on wired and wireless networks, internet connectivity, and high-end home automation and control systems for lighting, shading, and AV. As the Chief Technology Officer at Twisted Pear, I have the privilege to work with talented mentors and colleagues, tackling exciting and challenging projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a firm believer in self-education and the power of the internet as a vast knowledge resource. By sharing our knowledge with others, I believe that we can all grow and learn together. I advocate for a free, open, and net neutral internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, I love exploring London and embracing my passion for photography, which I had set aside after moving to the city. Originally from coastal Northumberland, I also relish the opportunity to spend time outdoors and breathe in the fresh air.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, I dream of learning to paramotor and experiencing the #vanlife! As a staunch supporter of sustainability through technology, I am excited about the prospect of a world powered by 100% renewable energy and sustainable industries.
