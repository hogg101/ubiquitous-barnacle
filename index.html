        <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Based in London, I am a systems integrator with a special focus on networking, WiFi, and surveillance. As CTO at Twisted Pear, I also specialise in automation and control systems for lighting and AV.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a firm believer in self-education and the power of the internet as a vast knowledge resource. By sharing our knowledge with others, I believe that we can all grow and learn together. I advocate for a free, open, and net neutral internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, I love exploring London and embracing my passion for photography, which I had set aside after moving to the city. Originally from coastal Northumberland, I also relish the opportunity to spend time outdoors and breathe in the fresh air.
